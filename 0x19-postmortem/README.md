# E-Commerce Platform Outage Postmortem

This README file provides a detailed postmortem of the outage that occurred on our e-commerce platform on June 20, 2024. The document outlines the issue summary, timeline, root cause, resolution, and corrective measures to prevent future incidents.

---

### Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Outage lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes from 10:00 AM to 12:15 PM UTC on June 20, 2024.

**Impact:**  
Our primary e-commerce platform was down, resulting in 100% of users being unable to browse products, place orders, or access their accounts. During this period, approximately 5,000 potential transactions were lost, leading to an estimated revenue loss of $50,000.

**Root Cause:**  
A misconfigured cron job triggered a heavy data migration script during peak usage hours, overloading the primary database server.

### Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating high database response times.
- **10:05 AM:** Operations team initiated investigation into the database performance issues.
- **10:15 AM:** Initial assumption was a DDoS attack due to the sudden spike in traffic.
- **10:30 AM:** Traffic analysis showed no signs of external attacks; focus shifted to internal processes.
- **10:45 AM:** Misleading path followed by investigating a recent application deployment for potential bugs.
- **11:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the database administration team.
- **11:15 AM:** Database logs revealed a heavy data migration script running.
- **11:30 AM:** Cron job identified as the culprit; script execution terminated.
- **11:45 AM:** Database performance began to stabilize.
- **12:00 PM:** Services gradually restored.
- **12:15 PM:** Full functionality confirmed and outage declared over.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
A rogue cron job executed a data migration script during peak hours, overloading the primary database server and causing the platform to become unresponsive.

**Resolution:**  
The immediate resolution involved terminating the data migration script and stopping the cron job responsible for its execution. The cron job schedule was corrected to run during off-peak hours, and a review process for cron job schedules was implemented.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
- Enforce a strict review process for scheduling maintenance scripts.
- Enhance monitoring to catch database load spikes before they become critical.
- Improve our incident response protocols to escalate issues to the appropriate teams quickly.

**Tasks:**
1. **Audit and Reschedule Cron Jobs:**  
   - Conduct a thorough review of all cron jobs and ensure they run during off-peak hours.
   - Implement a peer-review system for cron job scheduling changes.

2. **Upgrade Monitoring Systems:**  
   - Configure alerts for unusual database load patterns.
   - Set up automated notifications for significant changes in database performance metrics.

3. **Strengthen Incident Response:**  
   - Train the operations team to quickly identify and mitigate database performance issues.
   - Develop a clear and efficient escalation path for database-related incidents.

4. **Perform Regular Load Testing:**  
   - Implement a testing environment that simulates peak usage conditions to validate the impact of maintenance scripts.
   - Regularly conduct load testing to understand the database's capacity and identify potential bottlenecks.
